I'm Pranav Kedia, and I currently reside in Berlin, Germany, where I'm working as a research assistant for the EU H2020 project <a href="https://www.hiveopolis.eu/">'Hiveopolis'</a> at the <a href="http://berlinbiorobotics.blog/">Biorobtics Lab</a> led by <a href="https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/inf/groups/ag-ki/members/Professoren/Tim_Landgraf.html">Prof. Dr. Tim Landgraf</a> at  the <a href="https://www.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html">Free Univeristy of Berlin</a>.  I completed my master's majoring in electronics and communication with a specialization in embedded systems at <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/">IIIT-B</a>. Previously, I was fortunate to be part of the <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/sarl/sarl.html">Surgical and Assistive Robotics Lab</a>, led by <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty_page.php?name=madhavrao">Prof. Madhav Rao</a>. I was also part of the <a href="http://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/robotics/people.html">ARMS  lab</a>, led by <a href="https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~asinha/">Dr. Arpita Sinha</a> at IIT Bombay, India, in the summer of 2019. <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty/sachit-rao">Prof. Sachit Rao</a> has also supervised me on some guided coursework and non-coursework-related projects. </p> 
<p align="justify"><b>I enjoy working on Bio-inspired Swarm Robotics and Swarm Intelligence methods. You can find details of my <a href="https://praked.github.io/pranav-kedia-publications/">Publications</a> and <a href="https://praked.github.io/pranav-kedia-projects/">Projects</a> here.</b></p>

<p align="justify"> During my masters thesis last year, I developed a scalable distributed agent environment for swarm robotics experiments. The developed platform is a low-cost experimentation platform that can be used for any available swarm robot with minimal or no changes. The platform also exploits the phenomenon of Stigmergy, which is a mechanism
of indirect coordination, through the environment, between agents or actions. </p> 

<h2 align="left"> Research and other interests</h2>
<p align="justify"> I am interested in multi-agent and swarm robotics and its applications, human-robot interaction. Building novel robots has always excited me.</p> 

<p align="justify"> Apart from my work, I enjoy traveling and learning about new cultures and languages. I like to find interconnections and variations of languages in different places. I love to sketch and paint. I am also an avid reader of world politics and history.
